How to build:
    make clean && make

How to use:
    ./fastCDS [--opt_name=value] <input-ins>

e.g.,
    ./fastCDS --seed=1 --cutoff_time=3600 --for_small_ins=0 dir_ins

options:
    seed : random seed
    cutoff_time : cutoff time in second for fastCDS
    print_gap : show the current best solution when there are print_gap second left
    for_small_ins : when solve classic instance, please set it to 1, which only use SUB.

Output:
    The 'c' line : the comments.
    The 'o' line : the current best solution, in the format of "o current_best_soln found_time found_steps found_restart"
    The 's' line : the best solution fastCDS found before cutoff_time, in the format of "s best_soln found_time"
